# Language Learning Tool Program

## Description

A simple console program for practicing French-English translations. The program provides a quiz-like interface where users are prompted to translate words from one language to the other.

## Features

- **Translation Challenges**: The program presents English words and asks for the corresponding French translations.
- **Randomized Questions**: Words are presented in random order to enhance learning.

## Future Improvements

- **Addition of Sentences**: Planning to add more complex translation exercises that involve full sentences instead of individual words, providing a more challenging and realistic language learning experience.
- **English-to-French or French-to-English Options**: Adding the ability for users to choose the direction of translation, allowing for a more versatile and customized learning path.
- **Tracking User Progress**: Implementing features to track and visualize the user's progress over time, including accuracy rates and completed exercises, to motivate continuous improvement.
- **Enhanced Error Handling and User Input Validation**: Improving the robustness of the program by handling unexpected inputs and errors better, making the user experience smoother and less prone to issues.
- **Addition of Pronunciation Audio for Words and Sentences**: Adding an audio pronunciation for each word or sentence, allowing users to hear the correct pronunciation and enhance their listening and speaking skills.
- **Support For Other Languages**: Expanding the program to support other languages beyond just French, making it a useful tool for learners of various languages.
- **Addition of a GUI**: Developing a graphical user interface to replace the console-based interaction, improving usability and visual appeal, and making the program accessible to a broader audience.
